Hello, Dolly
Well, hello, Dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're lookin' swell, Dolly
I can tell, Dolly
You're still glowin'
You're still goin' strong
We feel the room swayin'
While the band's playin'
So, take her wrap, fellas
Find her an empty lap, fellas
Dolly'll never go away again

Golly, gee, fellas
Find her a vacant knee, fellas
Dolly'll never go away
Dolly'll never go away
